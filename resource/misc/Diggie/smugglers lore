At last, we stand foot at the remains of the Lupogg King.  Today is truly one to remember.
  It has cost us a lot to take over this beast, both in men and coin.  As the beast fell the ground shook with the might of Faren.  
As if nature was displeased with the creatures death.  As one of my men fell backwards I quickly reached out for him, 
attempting to prevent him from hitting the wall.  But instead he fell threw it!  Me and my men sat baffled in confusion.  
I slowly waved my had as I step forward, passing threw the wall as he did.  Behind the illusion we found a small tunnel, leading 
to solid rock.  After discussion with the rest of the men it came to our attention that this would be a perfect base for our 
base to coordinate future transactions between Jasper and Barloque.  We don't have nearly enough men to build such a home, we 
sent a few back to jasper, the rest stayed safe in the tunnel.  I did not wait for the recruitments, I began work not long
 after we rested.
