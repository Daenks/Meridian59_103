   % Biskalane begins inaccessible. Players cannot go there until

   % If TRUE, players will only run into each other one on one
   %    in the random desert areas. Groups will be split up as they transition
   %    between zones, and no screen will have more than 2 randomly assigned
   %    players. This makes combat 'fair', but building together difficult.
   pbEnforceOneVsOne = TRUE
   
   % If TRUE, all players in the random desert areas will be anonymized.
   %    This will prevent players from knowing who they are running across.
   %    Guild and ally dots will still be active, so the 
   %    effect will be to obscure your knowledge of your enemy's
   %    build, skills, and tactics.
