   % Imbues default active. Turning this to zero will temporarily disable them.
   %    They will remain in weapons and armor until turned on again.
   pbImbuesActive = 1

   % Base drop rate is one hundred percent. Zero turns off drops completely.
   ppBaseDropRate = 100

   % Can imbues be recovered from armor and weapons?
   % Default FALSE. If TRUE, players can recover imbues and re-use elsewhere.
   %
   % Designer's note: strong advisory AGAINST recoverable imbues without
   %   significant content support/changes. Recoverable imbues means players
   %   will develop 'pools' of awesome imbues that they just move around from
   %   armor to armor and character to character, which will significantly
   %   shorten the content system and greatly increase average player power.
