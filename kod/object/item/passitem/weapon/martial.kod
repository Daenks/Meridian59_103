% Martial weapons have no physical shape and are created temporarily whenever
% a player is not using any other weapon. They are used in lieu of an 
% actual weapon, making the code more consistent and streamlined by creating a 
% dummy weapon in cases where the weapon is not an item in the player's 
% inventory but one of his body parts, such as his fist or his shin.
% TLDR: Martial weapons are dummy weapons for handling unarmed combat.
