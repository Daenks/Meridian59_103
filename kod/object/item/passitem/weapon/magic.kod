% Magic weapons have no physical shape and are created temporarily and only
% exist for the duration of an enchantment, such as a touchspell. They are
% automatically used when the player is under the effect of such an enchantment
% and is not using a different weapon already. They are used in lieu of an 
% actual weapon, making the code more consistent and streamlined by creating a 
% dummy weapon in cases where the weapon is not an item in the player's 
% inventory but one of his body parts, such as his fist or his shin.
% TLDR: Magic weapons are dummy weapons for handling touchspells.
