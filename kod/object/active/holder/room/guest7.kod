      "In the upper right-hand corner of your screen, you'll see "
      "four stats: Health, Mana, Vigor and XP.\n\nHealth is simple - "
      "you lose it when you take damage (usually in battle).  If your health is "
      "reduced to zero, you die.\n\nMana determines how many spells "
      "you can cast.  Both Mana and Health come back with time.\n\n"
      "Vigor, the third stat, is very important.  How fast your "
      "Health and Mana return depends largely on your Vigor. Running requires "
      "Vigor - if it drops below 10, you will only be able to walk.  "
      "There are two ways to increase your vigor - by eating food "
      "([USE] it from your inventory) and by resting (click on the button "
      "in the toolbar above the graphics window).  Resting in inns and "
      "taverns will heal your vigor twice as quickly.  Taverns and stores "
      "also frequently sell foodstuffs that you can take with you as you "
      "explore.\n\n"
      "The last stat shows your \"experience points\" (XP) which determines "
      "when you will gain your next maximum hit point.  Looking at the "
      "description of a monster shows how many hit points you can get "
      "by killing them, though you will gain a small amount of XP by "
      "killing monsters at or a bit below your level.  Players with higher "
      "stamina will gain more XP from kills, and you can lose XP by dying "
      "once you lose your guardian angel (at 50 hit points).\n\n"
